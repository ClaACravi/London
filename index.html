<p>Munich is home to centuries-old buildings and numerous museums. The city has several of the largest breweries in Germany including the famed Hofbräuhaus, founded in 1589, and is famous for its beer and its annual Oktoberfest celebration. In the Altstadt (Old Town), central Marienplatz square contains landmarks such as Neo-Gothic Neues Rathaus (town hall), with a popular glockenspiel show that chimes and reenacts stories from the 16th century. </p>
